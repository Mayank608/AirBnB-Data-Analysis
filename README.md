# Room Availability and their price difference of NYC city from AirBNB Platform Data Analysis.


1. First Perform EDA and Feature Engineering to know about data.
    1. Handle missing values
    2. Remove duplicate values
    3. Deal with outliers
    4. check the format of the data
    5. check the shape of the data



2. While exploring data I made some tasks in which I need to find answers and after that, I can give my conclusion.

1. List the top ten host_id with the most values counts
2. what is the mean price and avg price of each neighbourhood_group of a room?
3. Distribution of neighbourhood_group
4. Distribution of neighbourhood of each neighbourhood_group
5. Distribution of room types
6. Check availability of rooms - how many rooms have low availability and how many have high availability.
7. check how many rooms have low availability in each neighbourhood_group and neighbourhood.
8. Room which has the highest number of number_of_reviews and highest reviews_per_month.
9. plot NYC map based on neighbourhood_group, room_type and availability.



After Analysing data I come up with the below conclusion:

1. Among all neighbourhood groups Manhattan group is on the top in room booking.
2. Manhattan rooms are the busiest rooms and they have less availability of rooms as well.
3. Manhattan rooms are also costlier than others.
4. Harlem neighbourhood is the first choice by people in Manhattan.
5. Two neighbourhoods Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant from the Brooklyn group are at the top in room booking.
